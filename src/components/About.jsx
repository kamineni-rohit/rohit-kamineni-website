          I'm Rohit Kamineni — a results-driven engineer with 4+ years of experience delivering scalable data and ML solutions in enterprise cloud environments.
          <br /><br />
          I specialize in building end-to-end data pipelines, real-time analytics platforms, and MLOps architectures using Python, SQL, Spark, Databricks, Airflow, Kafka, and Kubernetes.
          <br /><br />
          I’ve led projects that reduced operational overhead, improved personalization, and enabled rapid model deployment using GCP and Vertex AI. I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Business Analytics & Project Management at the University of Connecticut.
          <br /><br />
          I’m passionate about using data to solve meaningful problems at the intersection of engineering and business.
